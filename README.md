# Fofonso's SDL Game Engine

Hello!
This is my SDL Game Engine project, it's quite simple but it works!

Has a few cool features so far, but cant be used for anything yet, and even when its done, it will mostly be empty, its supposed to be like that and only be a framework for people to build on top
